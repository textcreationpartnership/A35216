            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Now of all Governments, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Families was the Original, which is commonly divided into three parts; That of <hi>Husband and Wife, Parents and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57812:8"/>
Children, Maſters and Servants.</hi> It is the laſt of theſe only, whereunto this preſent. Diſcourſe is deſigned; wherein we would endeavour in this laſt and worſt Age of the World, to give ſome motives and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to Servants, as to their indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Dutys towards their Maſters; but more particularly to Apprentices, that Genteel Servitude, which by a few years ſervice faithfully and diligently perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward their Maſters, lays a certain foundation for attaining Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in this world, and by Gods grace everlaſting happineſs in the life to come.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more plain nor certain, than that God Almighty hath ordained and appointed degrees of Authority and Subjection; allowing Authority to the Maſter, and commanding obedience from the ſervant unto him; for God hath given expreſs commands to Maſters to govern their Servants, and to Servants to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Maſters. As in the Fourth Commandment, Maſters are charged that they take care, their Servants <hi>do no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of work.</hi> And in the Sixteenth of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> the Angel biddeth <hi>Hagar humble her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf

under her Miſtriſs hands;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Epheſians,</hi> 6.5. gives long directions to ſervants, as to their obedience to their Maſters, many directions are likewiſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven both to Maſters and Servants in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their different places, how they are to deport themſelves to each other; As the many Laws preſcribed by <hi>Moſes</hi> to that purpoſe, and the ſeveral Precepts, Proverbs and Councels of King <hi>Solomon</hi> upon that account; as alſo thoſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and other Apoſtles. And further, Chriſtians in all Ages have aſſerted and owned this diſtinction; ſome of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been placed as Maſters, and others as Servants, and according to the Station which it hath pleaſed God to allot them, they have performed their mutual dutys; likewiſe the many Parables which our bleſſed Saviour maketh uſe of, and which he draws from the powers which Maſters have and exerciſe over their Servants, and the obedience required of them to their Maſters, do abundantly confirm the ſame. God hath alſo made divers promiſes both to Maſters and Servants that ſhall honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with a good Conſcience perform
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57812:9"/>
the ſeveral dutys of their relations, and hath ſet down divers threatnings againſt thoſe that are careleſs and negligent there in. All which Arguments are ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plentifully expreſt in the Word of God, that any perſon who is acquainted with the Holy Scriptures will be eaſily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied therein.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed: The next thing that an ingenious and well minded young man ought to do, is willingly to prepare and compoſe himſelf to ſome honeſt Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Imployment, wherein he may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards live ſerviceably and comfortably in his Generation. And to that end let him conſider, that it is diſhonourable to come into the World as an uſeleſs Cypher, or to ſtand in it, as <hi>a Tree that cumbers the ground;</hi> and that therefore he ought to endeavour to appear hereafter with ſome what of true worth upon the Stage; for God hath committed to all perſons ſome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Talents for improvement, though with great variety, and it will be expected at all our hands, that we bind not up our Lords Talent in a Napkin; but that we ſhould cheerfully addreſs our ſelves to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57812:9"/>
uſeful for the good of the whole, ſince we are all Gods witneſſes, that throughout the whole Creation, from the Angel in Heaven, to the Hyſop upon the Wall; from the Sun in the Firmament to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hidden in the bowels of the Earth; all of them labour to perform thoſe good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which God in his Wiſdom hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them unto.</p>
               <p>Therefore an induſtrious young man ſhould take example from theſe, and not ſtand idle in the Market-place, while all other creatures are thus induſtriouſly at work in the Lords Vineyard: to which purpoſe, his firſt care ought to be in the choice of his Calling, wherein we may obſerve too many to miſcarry; ſome by their unadviſedneſs therein, binding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it were, Apprentices to continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al temptations, and in effect, neceſſitate themſelves to the promoting the ſervice of Sin and Vanity in the World, which no man ought either to abet or ſhelter. Others again match themſelves to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments which their diſpoſitions can never affect, and ſo like <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gally-Slaves they toil themſelves heavily and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57812:10"/>
unwillingly in their Trades all their days.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rocks being avoided, every wiſe young man ought to aim that his Calling may be in its nature juſt and lawful in the management thereof, that it may comport with the publick Good, and ſerve for his own ſupport and maintenance, and in its kind, that it may be ſuitable in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to his own abilities and inclinations: and becauſe in theſe things he is young, unexperienced, and very ſubject to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, he ought to refer himſelf very far to the riper judgment and diſpoſal of his friends.</p>
               <p>And now having with their advice and conſent placed himſelf in his Calling, his next care ought to be, to ſettle his mind therein, and to reckon it to be the Sphere and Station which God hath appointed him to continue in, and to ſtudy to perform all the duties which are required from a true and faithful ſervant, which we ſhall reduce into ſeveral particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reſpect to, and fear of his Maſter, as ſet over him by Divine Authority, to have ſuch a reverend eſteem of his Maſter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57812:10"/>
as to count him worthy of all honour, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly enjoineth Servants to do, from whence proceeds, a dread of provoking him to wrath, and uſing all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and honeſt means to pleaſe him; and this kind of fear is intimated by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Epheſians</hi> 5.6. <hi>Servants be obedient to them that are your Maſters according to the fleſh with fear and trembling,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed this fear is ſo proper and neceſſary in a Servant, that where it is wanting there ſeems to be a plain denial of the place and power of a Maſter, which God himſelf intimateth in that expoſtulation, <hi>Malac.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If I be a Maſter where is my fear:</hi> as much as to ſay, it is apparent and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that you do not account me your Maſter, becauſe in your hearts you have no fear of me. Now where this fear is really implanted in the heart of a Servant, it will induce him faithfully to perform all duties to his Maſter, and the more it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth, the greater deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour will there be to pleaſe and content the Maſter, according to that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> 2.9. <hi>Exhort Servants to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto their own Maſters, and to pleaſe

them in all things;</hi> yea, it will rejoice the heart of a good Servant to ſee his Maſters Affairs proſper, of which we have a very worthy Example in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant, whoſe great care in his Maſters buſineſs; his praying for a Divine Bleſſing thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his thankfulneſs for his ſucceeding therein, was a clear evidence of that aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſpect and reverence which he bore toward his Maſter: Let a Servant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider that God hath placed his Maſter in his ſtead, and hath in part giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him his power; Maſters are the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Miniſters of God, and therefore the Title of Lord is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ter a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner given to Maſters in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 24.2. <hi>Epheſians</hi> 6.5. Now as Inferiour Magiſtrates are reverenced by the People, becauſe they repreſent the Perſon of the King, and receive their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power from him; ſo ought Servants to have reverence for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as thoſe that by Gods appointment are placed over them.</p>
               <p>Contrary to this, is that ſlaviſh fear, when a Servant is afraid of nothing but the revenging power of his Maſter, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57812:11"/>
Whip or the Rod, as we may ſay; and if they can avoid that, they take no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care whether their Maſter be pleaſed or not; this is that fear, which cauſeth Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to wiſh, that their Maſters had no power over them, or that they were rid of them; this is that fear which poſſeſſed the heart of that unprofitable Servant in St. <hi>Mathew</hi> 25. <hi>I knew that thou wert an hard man, and I was afraid;</hi> ſuch ſervile fear as this is, will never oblige a ſervant to be profitable to his Maſter.</p>
               <p>No leſs contrary to this awful Reſpect, is that light eſteem, and real contempt that ſome Servants have of their Maſters, which is apparent from that oppoſition, which God himſelf maketh between them in <hi>Malachy</hi> aforementioned, <hi>If I be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter where is my fear, O ye that deſpiſe my Name?</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, you do hereby ſhew that you do not fear me as a Maſter, becauſe you deſpiſe me; this ſin of deſpiſing Maſters is expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.2. and for this ſin Hagar <hi>was dealt hardly withal by</hi> Sarah, becauſe <hi>her Miſtriſs was deſpiſed in her eies.</hi> And when Maſters happen to be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57812:12"/>
poor, weak or aged, or otherwiſe infirm, it is then uſual for proud Servants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe their Maſters, which ſhews a very ill and unworthy mind, &amp; argues that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the power their Maſter exerciſeth over them, more than his Place and Office; for the meaneſt and weakeſt Maſters have of right the ſame Authority on their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as the richeſt and moſt wiſe; they all bear the image of God alike, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proud and diſdainful Servants, in ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, do in effect diſregard the image of God in them.</p>
               <p>Now this reſpect that is due from Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to their Maſters is diſcovered in their <hi>Words,</hi> that is by refraining to ſpeak in the preſence of their Maſter without ſome juſt cauſe: that expreſſion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Solomons</hi> Servants in 1 <hi>King</hi> 10.8. <hi>They ſtand continually before thee, and hear thy words:</hi> ſeems to intimate that they were ſlow to ſpeak, and ſwift to hear in the preſence of their Maſter, from that reſpect which they had toward him.</p>
               <p>Servan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s ought likewiſe to forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and anſwering again to their Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, eſpecially when they know it will be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57812:12"/>
offenſive to them; Thus St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when our bleſſed Saviour gave him this ſhort anſwer, <hi>what is that to thee? John</hi> 21.22. he forbore to ſpeak any more.</p>
               <p>To this may be added, Servants attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and regarding what their Maſters ſhall pleaſe to deliver to them, and ſhew ſuch kind of reſpect to their Maſters when they are ſpeaking to them, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did to God Almighty, in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.10. When he ſaid <hi>Speak Lord for thy Servant heareth.</hi> This reverence likewiſe did <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant ſhew to his Maſter, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Wife for his Son <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 25, 9.</p>
               <p>And for the better ordering of their Speech toward their Maſters, it is nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary that Servants conſider when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them to ſpeak, and that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when their Maſters require it of them, as our Saviour did of his Diſciples in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 16.13. when he asked them, <hi>whom do men ſay, that I the Son of Man am?</hi> Or elſe, when they know it is for the intereſt of their Maſters to ſpeak to them, that is, when they know o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> any thing that may be for the advantage
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57812:13"/>
and profit of their Maſters, then they ought to declare it though they be not asked, and this was the caſe of the Servant of <hi>Naaman,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.13. who obſerving the loathſome diſeaſe wherewith her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was infected, ſhe without asking, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her Miſtriſs that there was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in <hi>Samaria</hi> who would recover him of his Leproſy: and ſometimes a Maſter may through ignorance or paſſion refuſe to do what his Servant is ſatisfied will be for his benefit; in which caſe it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Servants to perſwade them to it; and thus did ſome others of the Servants of <hi>Naaman</hi> in the place aforementioned, when they perſwaded their Maſter to waſh himſelf in the River of <hi>Jordan</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> adviſed him to do.</p>
               <p>Alſo if Servants do not fully underſtand the will of their Maſters, as to what they are ſenſible they ought to do, then are they to know the will of their Maſters therein, and thus did the Diſciples of our Lord act in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 25.17. when they asked their Maſter, <hi>where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Paſſover?</hi> Or when ſome ſcruple ariſeth in their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57812:13"/>
minds, as to the management of thoſe Aff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>airs wherein they are imployed, then ought they to inquire of their Maſters, as the Servant of <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.5. when he ſaid, <hi>what if the Woman will not come with me?</hi> Or Laſtly, when their Maſter unjuſtly ſuſpecteth them to be guilty of what they are innocent in, then may they lawfully vindicate themſelves to their Maſter, as <hi>David</hi> did to <hi>Saul</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.9. <hi>And David ſaid to Saul, wherefore heareſt thou mens words, ſaying, Behold David ſeeketh thy heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet let them ſtill be careful that their way and manner of ſpeaking be with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and reſpect to their Maſters, and to this purpoſe let them ſpeak to them with reſpectful Titles. It was a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy reſpect which the Servants of <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> uſed toward him, when they called him, <hi>My Father;</hi> let Servants words be few when they ſpeak to their Maſters, and let them uſe no more than is neceſſary; let them be likewiſe humble and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. Obſerve but how the Children of the Prophets managed their diſcourſe with their Maſter <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 1 <hi>King</hi> 6.1, 2.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57812:14"/>
They firſt humbly beg leave that they may go to <hi>Jordan,</hi> then they beſeech him to go in theſe words, <hi>Vouchſafe we pray thee to go with thy Servants,</hi> and when one of them had loſt the Head of his Hatchet, he ſeems afraid poſitively to ask his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to reſtore it again, but refers it to his pleaſure, only crys out, <hi>Alas Maſter, for it was borrowed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Servants ought alſo to obſerve conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſeaſons for ſpeaking to their Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as when they know they are at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to hear them; and this is remarked of our Saviours Diſciples, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.10. That when their Maſter was alone they propounded their Queſtions to him; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when they ſee their Maſters mind is not diſquieted or diſturbed with Paſſion, thus when <hi>David</hi> obſerved that the mind of <hi>Saul</hi> was ſomewhat pacified by the words which he uttered, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.17. <hi>Is this thy voice my Son David?</hi> he from thence took encouragement more freely to diſcourſe with him.</p>
               <p>Servants ſhould likewiſe, give ready and preſent anſwers to what their Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers demand of them, and this is often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended

                  </gap>d Saviour propounded any queſtion to his Diſciples, he would return a preſent and ready anſwer thereunto. But above all things, let their ſpeeches and anſwers to their Maſters be nothing but what is truth; let them by no means dare to tell a Lye, according to that of the Poet:
<q>
                     <l>Ever ſpeak Truth, nothing can need a Lye,</l>
                     <l>A fault that needs it moſt, grows two thereby.</l>
                  </q>
This diſcovers a very reverend reſpect to a Maſter; when <hi>Eli</hi> demanded of young <hi>Samuel</hi> what the Lord ſaid to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. we read that, <hi>Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him.</hi> And when <hi>David</hi> charged the Woman of <hi>Tekoah not to hide the thing that he ſhould ask her from him,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.18, 19. She told him the whole truth: and this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are obliged to do, both upon the account of Conſcience toward God, who is a God of Truth and cannot lye, and out of reſpect to their Maſters, with whom they ought to deal faithfully in all things,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57812:15"/>
and therefore, Laſtly, ſhould ſpeak ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably of their Maſters behind their backs, ſpeaking good of them and not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: and this Reſpect did <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant likewiſe diſcover toward his maſter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now contrary to that reſpect in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned particulars, is that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and boldneſs in Servants, which is now too much in faſhion, whereby Servants ſeem to have no regard to their maſters preſence; but are full of idle and impertin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſcourſe, even before, or within hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their maſter: anſwering again, and repeating the words of their maſters, is likewiſe contrary to this reſpect, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions much trouble and diſturbance; ſo is impatience alſo, when they will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear their maſters make an end of their diſcourſe, but will either intempt them, or go away from them.</p>
               <p>Stubbornneſs, or refuſing to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of what is demanded of them, though their ſilence may be prejudicial to their maſters or themſelves, is contrary to that reſpect which is due to their maſters: and ſo is Pride and Arrogancy in ſpeaking to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57812:15"/>
their maſters, which proceeds ſometimes from Servants deſpiſing, or diſdaining of their maſters for their Poverty, or ſome other reaſon, and ſometimes from Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants overvaluing themſelves, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves better than he, by reaſon of their Birth, Parentage or Education, which occaſions them to forget the preſent circumſtances they are in, and the place and condition wherein they are; from whence proceed too low and mean thoughts of their maſters, and too high and preſumptuous conceits of themſelves; and this doth often occaſion muttering and murmuring upon every inconſiderable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and is the occaſion many times of much diſturbance, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 15.1. <hi>Grievous words ſtir up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anger.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>aſonable or impertinent interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their maſters, is alſo a ſign of very little reſpect, eſpecially when his mind is intent upon ſome urgent or important affair, and this the people ſeem guilty of in St. <hi>Mark</hi> 3 32. when they interrupted our Saviour while he was preaching to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57812:16"/>
them, by telling him, that <hi>his Mother and his Brethren were without to ſeek him:</hi> ſpeaking to their Maſters while they are in Paſſion, is very unbecoming to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and hath often occaſioned great miſchief and damage; and ſo hath ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs, or want of ſpeaking in Servants when they have been required thereunto. Holy <hi>Job</hi> among his many other afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and calamities complains of this as one, <hi>I called my Servant and he gave me no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Job.</hi> 19.16.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially lying, is very ſinful and wicked, when a Servant ſhall endeavour to hide or conceal a fault thereby, and is very contrary to that reſpect which is due to a Maſter; Lying is in it ſelf a very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſin, but hath far greater aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when it is impoſed upon thoſe who have authority over us, and are thereby the Repreſentatives of the Almighty: when <hi>Gehazi</hi> had cunningly got Mony and Garments from <hi>Naaman,</hi> and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter inquired of him where he had been, he very briskly replies, <hi>Thy Servant went no whither,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.25. whereupon <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> to deter all Servants from ſuch wicked
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57812:16"/>
practices for the future, immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes the judgment of <hi>Naaman</hi> upon him, <hi>The Leproſie therefore of</hi> Naaman <hi>ſhall cleave unto thee and to thy ſeed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is very wicked in a Servant to diſgrace or ſpeak evil of his maſter in his abſence, for though what he may ſay of his maſter may be true, yet ought he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conceal his faults and infirmities than diſcover them; how much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable is it then to raiſe falſe and ſlanderous reports of his maſter; this was a monſtrous and ingrateful wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Ziba</hi> againſt his maſter <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.3. and ought to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all honeſt and faithful Servants.</p>
               <p>And as Servants ought to be reſpectful to their maſters in <hi>words,</hi> ſo likewiſe in their <hi>Carriage and Behaviour</hi> toward them; and therefore according to cuſtoms or places wherein they are, they ought to uſe all ſubmiſſiveneſs towards them, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, coming from them, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any charge from them, or bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meſſage to them. When <hi>Iſaac</hi> gave his Bleſſing to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 27.29. he gives him this as part of it, <hi>Be Lord over thy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57812:17"/>
Brethren, and let thy Mothers Sons bow down to thee:</hi> which ſeems to determine the poſture of a Servant, and likewiſe his duty therein. And therefore when the Children of the Prophets ſaw that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their maſter <hi>Elijah</hi> reſted upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha,</hi> 2 <hi>King</hi> 2.15. they preſently conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be an evident demonſtration, that God had appointed him to be a Maſter and Governour over them, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>they came to meet him, and bowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ground before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the whole behaviour of a Servant toward his maſter ought to be managed with ſuch modeſty and humility, as may plainly diſcover an honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him, as by ſtanding in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his maſter, to ſignify that he is ready to perform any ſervice which his maſter ſhall require of him; and this was one thing which was taken notice of, and commended by the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> in the Servants of <hi>Solomon</hi> 1 <hi>Kin</hi> 10.5. fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>THE Apparel and Cloths worn by Servants, ought to be according to their quality and decree, and not to exceed their Maſters, as is too much uſed in theſe days; ſince one end of our Apparel is to diſtinguiſh between ſuperiors and inferiors, and therefore it muſt neceſſarily ſhew a great diſreſpect in a Servant, to exceed his Maſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. An ingenious Servant is eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with mean, but becoming Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he knows the time of his life will be but ſhort, and therefore thinks it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that his thoughts about ſuch inferiour things ſhould be long. Fond cares about the body do too frequently entice away the ſtrength of the mind after them.</p>

thoſe are the garments that will make them appear lovely in Gods Eies, yea, and in Mens too; for there are none but Fools and Idiots, who will not value per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more for being good, than becauſe of their fine cloths.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For let us but conſider to what end our Clothing and Apparel was deſigned, and we ſhall have no great cauſe to be proud of it: one end was the covering of our nakedneſs, as we may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.21. and that was the effect of the firſt ſin, and therefore we have cauſe to be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and humbled, as having loſt that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency which was a much greater Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than any the moſt glorious Apparel can be; and from hence we are ingaged to have our Cloths modeſt, that it may anſwer the end of covering our ſhame. Another end of our Apparel is, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the body from cold, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to preſerve the health of the body. Laſtly, Another is, the differencing and diſtinguiſhing of Sexes, and likewiſe of Qualities, as was intimated; God hath placed ſome in a higher condition than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and in proportion to their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57812:20"/>
it is neceſſary their clothing ſhould be; and therefore it befits Servants always to remember their preſent State and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to cloth themſelves accordingly, and if they deſire to adorn themſelves, let it be as St. <hi>Peter</hi> adviſeth perſons in his time, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>In the hidden man of the heart, even the ornament of a meek and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſpirit.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Servants Obedience to their Maſters.</head>
               <p>CErtainly no inferiors are more obliged to Obedience than Servants; it is their chief and principal duty, and expreſly commanded in the Scriptures, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Servants be obedient to them that are your Maſters,</hi> &amp;c. and indeed all other dutys are comprehended under obedience; ſo that thoſe who are contrary minded, who are rebellious, and diſdain to be under the command of their Maſters, and are ready to ſay with thoſe in St. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14. <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us,</hi> ought to be accounted as Enemies to God and all Civil Authority and Government; for how can they pretend to acknowledge them to be their Maſters, if they deny all lawful ſubjection to them?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57812:21"/>2. Now the Obedience required of a Servant to his Maſter, conſiſteth either in not doing any thing without the advice, or againſt the conſent of his Maſter; or in readily obeying and performing all the lawful commands of his Maſter: as to the firſt, Servants ought to forbear to do any thing without, or againſt the conſent of their Maſters, becauſe that during the time of their Service, they are not their own men, neither ought they to do any thing upon their own account; both their perſons and actions are all their Maſters, the will of their Maſters muſt be their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute rule and guide in all things which are not contrary to the Will of God. We have a very notable example in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Servant, who when he was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Maſter in a matter of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he propounds all ſuch ſcruples as he could then think of to his Maſter, that he might receive direction from him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that ſo he might not be obliged to do any thing of his own head without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular order and warrant from his Maſter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And this part of a Servants duty will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57812:21"/>
appear more plain and evident by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſome particular inſtances, of theſe things which a Servant ought not to do without the conſent of his Maſter, as we find them recorded in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Servants ought not to go whither they pleaſe without the knowledge of their Maſters, that expreſſion of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 8.9. <hi>I ſay to one go, and he goeth,</hi> ſeems ſtrongly to imply, that without the conſent of his Maſter a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ought not to abſent himſelf from his Service: and therefore thoſe Servants who watch their opportunities to go whither they liſt, when their Maſters are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about ſome urgent affairs, or at night when their Maſters are gone to their reſt, are very much to be blamed, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly come ſhort of that obedience which is required of Servants, beſides the dangerous conſequences which commonly proceed from ſuch ill practices: thus <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi</hi> the leud Servant of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> watched his opportunity to run after <hi>Naaman</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that his Maſter would know nothing of it, but the dreadful effect thereof upon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57812:22"/>
him and his Poſterity, may be a ſufficient warning to all other Servants for the time to come, 2 <hi>King</hi> 5.20.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Servants ought not to manage their own Affairs and Concerns and neglect that of their Maſters; it is obſerved that <hi>Jacob</hi> while he was a Servant to <hi>Laban,</hi> though he had a Flock of his own, yet he fed his Maſters Flocks, and committed his own into the hands of his Sons, for them to keep and look after, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.25. which is contrary to the practice of ſome Servants, who being bound faithfully to ſerve their Maſters, yet do their own buſineſs, and ſtudy and contrive their own profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage without the licenſe or knowledge of their Maſters, and this was the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the crime of <hi>Gehazi,</hi> and made it, as it were, private ſtealing, by his with, drawing himſelf from the ſervice of his maſter, and going to receive gifts upon his own account, and thus faulty are many unfaithful ſervants who will make uſe of their maſters Credit and Reputation for their own benefit and profit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Servants ought not to do what buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they themſelves pleaſe, though in it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57812:22"/>
ſelf lawful, and upon their maſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; we read in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.19. that <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maaz</hi> had a great deſire to carry the news of the death of <hi>Abſalom</hi> to King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> yet he would not preſume to do it without leave given him by <hi>Joab,</hi> who was his Captain and maſter; it is ſaid <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> 31.15. that <hi>the virtuous Woman or Miſtreſs giveth a Portion to her Maidens,</hi> that is, the portion of work which they are to do by her appointment. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the <hi>Centurion</hi> every one perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that part of their duty which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them: and thoſe ſervants that had their Talents committed to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.16. each of them was ſolicitous for the improvement of his own Talent; therefore ſervants ought not to chuſe their own work, or to do only that part of it which pleaſeth them, or elſe wholly to neglect it, or do it with much unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs or diſcontent.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Servants ought not to marry during the time of their ſervice, and this Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices generally oblige themſelves not to do by their own conſent in their Indentures, without leave from h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ir maſters; and the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57812:23"/>
Law of God in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.4. allows a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to marry, <hi>if his Maſter give him a Wife,</hi> which implys that he may not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without his leave, and therefore when St. <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2. ſays, <hi>To avoid fornication let every man have his Wife,</hi> &amp;c. he diſcovers what means God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for every one to avoid Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet not that every one ſhould make uſe of it, when it may happen to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſome other Command or Order ordained of God; for this precept is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to thoſe that are within their own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but ſervants and children are to be directed by their Maſters and Parents: However, if neceſſity require, ſervants have liberty to acquaint their maſters with their deſires, and to uſe all lawful means for the obtaining liberty, or the aſſent of their maſter therein.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Servants ſhould not diſpoſe of the Goods of their maſter at their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nay, though it may be to charitable uſes. The Steward in St. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.1, 2. who waſted his maſters Goods was juſtly deprived of his office for the ſame; yea, in the 8th <hi>verſe</hi> he is called the <hi>unjuſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57812:23"/>
Steward,</hi> for diſpoſing of ſome of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Goods, for his own future mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and therefore it was a point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and unlawful; and though it is ſaid <hi>the Lord commended him;</hi> the intent thereof only is, that he commended his Wiſdom therein, but not his injuſtice; he commended his care for providing for the future, not the way and means he made uſe of for obtaining it; neither ought ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be liberal in diſpoſing of their maſters Goods, or to think that without their leave they may give them to the Poor; for pretence of Charity is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for Injuſtice, and therefore they ought to give their maſter or miſtriſs an account that ſuch things are in the Houſe, and meet to be diſpoſed of for the relief of the Poor; but without the knowledge and conſent of their maſters, they ought to diſpoſe of nothing.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Servants ought not to go from their maſters till the time of ſervice which they have covenanted with them, be expired, when <hi>Jacob</hi> after a very long Apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to <hi>Laban,</hi> had a deſire to go away from him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.26. <hi>he asked leave,</hi> and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57812:24"/>
becauſe his Uncle and Maſter was unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to part with him he continued ſtill with him; and though it is afterward ſaid, that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtole away privily from his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; yet it is plain, that the Covenanted time of his Service was out, and that he had an expreſs Command and Warrant from God Almighty to be gone; and therefore his example herein is neither to be inſiſted on, nor followed, without ſuch an extraordinary Call thereunto, which is not now to be expected. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe two ſervants who ran away from their maſter <hi>Shimei</hi> in the 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.39. are charged therewith by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and it is Recorded to their ſhame and infamy; and <hi>Oneſimus</hi> who run away from his maſter, is ſent back by St. <hi>Paul, Philemon verſ.</hi> 22. And <hi>Hagar</hi> is by an Angel commanded to <hi>return home to her Miſtriſs, Gen.</hi> 16.9. And though it may be objected that their Maſters are cruel and ſevere, as it is ſaid <hi>Sarah</hi> was to <hi>Hagar,</hi> yet an Angel from Heaven commanded her to go back, and <hi>ſubmit her ſelf under the hand of her miſtriſs,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:57812:24"/>
2.18, 19. gives this poſitive charge to ſervants. <hi>Be ſubject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but alſo the froward; for this is thank-worthy, if a man for conſcience toward God endure grief, ſuffering wrongfully.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Obedience to the Commands of Maſters.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HAVING briefly diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of what Servants ought not to do if they would te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their obdience to their Maſters. Let us in the next place conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is their duty herein: The firſt and principal part whereof, is a very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing performance of all the lawful commands of their Maſter; the power of commanding is in the Maſter,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57812:25"/>
and the duty of obeying in the Servant; and therefore the peculiar duty of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, is to have reſpect to his maſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and to do what he requireth him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And thus the Prophet <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the property of a good ſervant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.2. <hi>The eyes of Servants look to the hands of their Maſters;</hi> which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>looking,</hi> as it implyeth an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of relief and ſuccour: So likewiſe it intendeth a willing and ready mind to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute any command that their maſters ſhould lay upon them. And the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.9. commendeth this duty in his ſervants, who performed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he commanded them: and ſo alſo are the ſervants of <hi>Abraham, Elijah</hi> and others; and our bleſſed Saviour in St. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.7, 8. ſeems to exact and require this duty of ſervants; when he intimates, That though a Servant have been all the day long at plow, which is a very tireſome and laborious employment, yet when he cometh home, if his maſter command him to <hi>dreſs his Supper, and wait,</hi> he muſt do it. By all which Inſtances it appeareth, that if a maſter command his ſervant to come
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57812:25"/>
or go, to do this or that, he ought to obey him therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When ſervants therefore refuſe to perform the commands of their maſter, This is the higheſt degree of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and this was a great crime in <hi>Ziba,</hi> the ſervant of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> who when he was commanded to ſaddle his maſters Aſs, that he might meet King <hi>David</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.20. went away and did it not, which might have hapned to have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prejudicial to his maſter; and thus <hi>Job</hi> laments and complains of his ſervants; who being called would not anſwer nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, <hi>Job</hi> 19.16. And this indeed of all other offences, is the moſt provoking, becauſe it diſcovers the greateſt contempt of the power and authority of a maſter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And this obedience of Servants, muſt not be a grumbling and unwilling ſervice, but ready and chearful, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.5, 7. <hi>Servants obey your Maſters in all things, with good will, doing ſervice,</hi> and to help them therein, they are to conſider that it is <hi>to the Lord and not to men;</hi> our bleſſed <hi>jeſus took upon hius the form of a ſervant, Phil.</hi> 2.7. and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57812:26"/>
hath in that caſe left his own example as an excellent pattern, for <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40.8. he ſaith, <hi>I delight to do thy will;</hi> ſpeaking to God that ſent him. and St. <hi>John</hi> 4.34, <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work</hi> Intimating that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did do the work of him that ſent him, with the ſame willingneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and chearfulneſs that a man eats his meat when he is hungry: and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved his Uncle <hi>Laban</hi> chearfully, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.20. <hi>So that ſeven years ſeemed to him but a few days;</hi> and though one reaſon thereof was his love to <hi>Rachel;</hi> yet if he had not had ſome kindneſs and reſpect to his maſter and his ſervice, the time might have ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tedious enough; but however, if the Love of <hi>Rachel</hi> cauſed <hi>Jacob</hi> to perform his ſervice ſo chearfully; then if ſervants love God, for whoſe ſake they ought to do their duty, and who hath promiſed, <hi>that whatſoever good thing a man doth, the ſame he ſhall receive of the Lord, whether he be Bond or Free, Eph.</hi> 6.8. then ſhould they execute all the commands of their maſters with chearfulneſs and willingneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And indeed that temper of mind
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57812:26"/>
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, is requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:57812:31"/>
exhorts <hi>Titus,</hi> 2.6. that is, not making ſuch ſurly and rude replies, as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the diſpleaſure of their Maſters, a thing too frequently practiſed by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, even when there is juſt cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, whereas St. <hi>Peter</hi> directs them to ſuffer, even the moſt undeſerved cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>even when they do well and ſuffer for it,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. when the Apoſtle gives them an expreſs command which is ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and inforced by many reaſons, <hi>Servants be ſubject to your Maſters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but to the froward, for this is thankworthy, if a man for Conſcience toward God, indure grief, ſuffering wrongfully; for what glory is it, if when you are buffeted for your faults, you take it patiently? This is acceptable with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. From which Precept of St. <hi>Peter</hi> it is very clear and evident, That correction is to be patiently endured by Servants, and if ſo, then much more reproof, and though correction may ſometimes happen to be unjuſtly inflicted; yet it is to be ſuffered quietly, and therefore by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence much more, when it is deſervedly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57812:32"/>
laid upon them; and if <hi>buffeting,</hi> and that from a <hi>froward Maſter,</hi> be thus ſubmiſſively to be born, then much more the lighter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes and Corrections of a good and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet Maſter. <hi>Joſeph</hi> patiently endured <hi>Fetters, Iron Chains and Impriſonment,</hi> though they were unjuſtly inflicted upon him; even for his Juſtice and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Maſter, but great was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence which he received of God for the ſame, and there is nothing more ſure, than that the righteous Lord of Heaven will render recompences to thoſe his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who ſhall endure pains and grief and wrong for the ſake of a good Conſcience, and in purſuance of their duty toward God; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>this is thank-worthy,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, it is worthy of praiſe and commendation, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of reward. He ſaith likewiſe, it is <hi>acceptable to God;</hi> ſo that though men may account it baſeneſs and meanneſs of ſpirit, nay, though proud and unjuſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may from thence take occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and trample upon their Servants, yet God will recompence them for the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:57812:32"/>3. For this is one of the principal Rules of our Chriſtian Profeſſion, which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe intimated by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſays, <hi>even hereunto were ye called;</hi> and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion requireth all men, <hi>to give place unto wrath, Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>to turn the other Cheek when one is ſmitten,</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.39. <hi>to overcome evil with goodneſs, Rom.</hi> 12 21. Now if all good Chriſtians are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to uſe ſo much patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance toward their equals, how much more ought Servants to ſuffer it from their Maſters, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Example of our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf in this caſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>who when he was reviled, reviled not again;</hi> and <hi>when he ſuffered,</hi> and that moſt injuriouſly, yet he patiently endured all; and let Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants remember, that if they ſuffer with Jeſus Chriſt, they ſhall likewiſe reign with him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And therefore if it ſhould happen, that a Servant ſhould be unjuſtly reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Maſter, and charged with what he is altogether innocent of, yet an angry and paſſionate contradicting his Maſter, may chance to be of very ill conſequence,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57812:33"/>
and therefore if he thinks fit to undeceive his Maſter, that ſo he may no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to have an-ill Opinion of him, let him humbly and meekly vindicate himſelf when he ſhall find a convenient opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Nay, though a Servant ſhould be likewiſe unjuſtly corrected, yet ought he to make no reſiſtance, ſince our Saviour himſelf could very eaſily have freed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his Perſecutors, but would not, and his Example is recommended to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for if Servants ſuffer for Conſcience ſake, they will not reſiſt, though it be in their power ſo to do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Much leſs will they ſtudy to revenge themſelves upon their Maſters, as ſome wicked Servants have deſigned to do; for this proceeds from a malicious and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate mind; and thoſe who in their heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="6">6. But the patient ſuffering of rebuke is not all that is required of Servants i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> this matter, they muſt alſo amend th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57812:33"/>
think that they have done enough, when they have (though never ſo dutifully) giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their Maſter the hearing; and it may ſometimes happen, that a real amendment of former faults, may cauſe a Servant to be better, and more uſeful than before he committed them; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate in his Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon ver.</hi> 11. where ſpeaking of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>In time paſt he was to thoſe unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. If Servants therefore, after being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, go on ſtill in their evil and indirect courſes, and thereby add greater Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to their Maſters, they are to be reckoned either proud and ſcornful, (and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>a ſcorner beareth no Rebuke, Prov.</hi> 13.1.) or elſe, that it proceeds from a baſe, ſervile, brutiſh diſpoſition, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>An hundred ſtripes enter not into him, Prov.</hi> 17.14. and is one of thoſe fools whom <hi>Solomon</hi> characterizeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.22. <hi>Though thou ſhouldſt bray a fool in a Mortar among Wheat, with a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, yet will not his fooliſhneſs depart from him.</hi> But much worſe is the temper of thoſe ſervants, who grow more extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant

extravagant for being rebuked and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; certainly, ſuch as theſe muſt expect nothing but ſhame, beggery, or ſome ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death, without ſpeedy amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reformation.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57812:34"/>
faithfulneſs doth properly and abſolutely belong to Servants; and our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour joineth goodneſs and faithfulneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21. <hi>Well done thou good and faithful Servant,</hi> which intimates, that a Servants <hi>goodneſs</hi> conſiſteth in his <hi>faithfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And this fidelity in Servants is very advantagious both to their Maſters and themſelves; the benefit that accrues to Maſters thereby, <hi>Solomon</hi> taketh notice of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.13. <hi>As the cold of Snow</hi> (is very pleaſant, refreſhing and comfortable) <hi>in the time of Harveſt</hi> (when men are even ready to faint with heat) <hi>ſo is a faithful meſſenger to them that ſend him, for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> by our Saviour, who thereby likewiſe diſcovereth his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rewarding thereof; St. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.21. <hi>Well done thou good and faithful Servant, thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Every Servant muſt be called to an account, if not by his Maſter on Earth,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57812:35"/>
yet by his Maſter in Heaven, who will then ſay to every one, <hi>Give an account of thy Stewardſhip. Luke</hi> 16.2. Now if Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be not faithful, what other ſentence can they expect, then that which was pronounced upon that wicked, ſlothful and unprofitable Servant, who <hi>hid his Talent in a Napkin, Mat.</hi> 25.30. <hi>Caſt ye the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servant into utter darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Now this fidelity in Servants conſiſts in ſeveral particulars; whatſoever is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a Maſter into the hand of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant muſt by him be carefully preſerved: And that expreſſion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 20. <hi>keep that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thy truſt,</hi> ſeems to be a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor taken from the duty of Servants; and great was the faithfulneſs of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in this kind, which cauſed his Maſter to <hi>put all that he had into his hand, Gen.</hi> 39.4. the fidelity of <hi>Jacob</hi> was likewiſe very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.38. for in twenty years wherein he had the keeping of his Maſter <hi>Labans</hi> Cattel, <hi>the Ews and the ſhe Goats caſt not their young, neither were the Rams of the Flocks devoured,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57812:35"/>5. If Servants therefore obſerve any da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to be done to their Maſter's Goods (which are under their charge) by others, they muſt carefully endeavour to prevent it, or to give an account thereof to their Maſters, that it may be redreſſed, as thoſe Servants did which are mentioned in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 13.27. who gave notice to their Maſters, that Tares ſprang up in his Field inſtead of good Corn. And this Duty is indeed abſolutely neceſſary in a Servant; for every Maſter is ſuppoſed to intruſt his Affairs, as well to the care, as to the honeſty of a Servant, for it would be little advantage to a Maſter to be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that his Servant himſelf would not cheat him, whilſt in the mean time, he would by his careleſsneſs give opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to others to do it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Servants ought likewiſe to endeavour to advance and promote their Maſter's Eſtate and Concerns; <hi>the little</hi> that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> had, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. was by the faithfulneſs of <hi>Jacob</hi> in this kind <hi>encreaſed into a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi> And the Talents, which were committed to the truſt of the two faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants, in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 25. were by
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57812:36"/>
their care and induſtry encreaſed into as many more; ſo that Servants do not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſcharge their duty by not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing their Maſters Eſtates, unleſs they improve it; for he that kept his Maſter's Talent ſafe, was accounted an unprofitable Servant, and received a very ſevere doom accordingly; therefore he that does not carefully look to his Maſters profit, deceives his Truſt as well, as he that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly provides for his own.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And this is another chief part of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in a Servant, the not converting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of his Maſters Goods to his own uſe, without leave and allowance from him, or retaining any thing that is due to his Maſter; and this is that <hi>Purloining</hi> which the Apoſtle expreſly chargeth Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants not to be guilty of, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.10. <hi>not purloining, but ſhewing all good fidelity;</hi> and this word <hi>purloin,</hi> is the ſame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the fraud and deceit of <hi>Ananias</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.2. who <hi>kept back</hi> part of the price for which the Poſſeſſion was ſold. And this indeed is no better than arrant Theft.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:57812:36"/>8. Now under this Head may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; not only open and manifeſt Robbing of their Maſters, by ſtealing their Money, or conveying away their Goods; but thoſe other waies, that a Servant hath of gaining to himſelf, by the loſs and damage of his Maſter, as being bribed to make ill bargains, concealing part of the price which he hath received for his Maſters Goods; borrowing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his maſters name; charging more expence to his Maſters account than hath been truly expended; inveigling away his Maſter's Cuſtomers, or purloining the Mens Goods committed into the Cuſtody of his Maſter, to his great diſcredit and damage many times. And indeed this ſort of unfaithfulneſs, is worſe than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Theft; for by how much there is a greater truſt repoſed in any Perſon, ſo much the more doth the betraying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of add to the crime.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Fidelity of a Servant is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expreſſed in the doing all true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his Maſter, not only when his Eye is over him, and he expects puniſhment for his omiſſions and neglects; but at all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57812:37"/>
times even when his Maſter is not likely to diſcern his ſailing; and that Servant that doth not make conſcience of this, is far from being a faithful Servant; This Eye-ſervice being by the Apoſtle put in oppoſition to that ſingleneſs of heart which he requires in Servants, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.6. not with <hi>Eye-ſervice as Men-pleaſers, but as the Servants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart.</hi> Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> feared his Maſter in ſingleneſs of heart; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he refuſed to abuſe his Maſter, by committing wickedneſs with his Miſtriſs, though ſhe was in a private Chamber, and none but themſelves in the Houſe. Happy is it for Maſters when they have ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as he was, that they took no more care than <hi>Potiphar</hi> did, who committed all his Concerns into the hands of <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. How unfaithful then are thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who act with a double heart, when they perform only Hypocritical Service to their Maſters, who are really <hi>Eye-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> and ſuch a Servant was <hi>Gehazi, who came in and ſtood before his Maſter,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.25. as if he had performed ſome conſiderable ſervice for him; when in the
<pb facs="tcp:57812:37"/>
mean time, he had almoſt highly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him; and ſuch a wicked Servant was <hi>Judas,</hi> who had as plauſible a carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and behaviour before his Maſter as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of the Diſciples, St. <hi>John</hi> 13 29. and yet was an horrid Traytor in his heart; for when it was thought that he went out to buy Proviſions for his Maſter, at that very time he went purpoſely to betray him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. A Servants faithfulneſs is likewiſe diſcovered, in diſpatching all the affairs of his Maſter, which are under his hand, and to endeavour that they proſper; It is noted concerning <hi>

The Apoſtle commands that putting away lying, <hi>we ſpeak every man truth to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and again <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Lye not one to another. A Lying Tongue</hi> is mentioned by <hi>Solomon</hi> as one of thoſe things <hi>that are an abomination to the Lord;</hi> yea, ſo much doth God hate a Lye, that he will not endure it for the moſt pious and religious end: The Man that lyes, though in a zeal to Gods glory ſhall yet be judged as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.7. What ſhall then become of thoſe multitudes of men, that lye quite upon other ends; ſome out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to miſchieve others; ſome out of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs to defraud their Neighbours;

And as to God Almighty, 'tis mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to hope that all their Arts can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe them from him, who needs none of thoſe ways for diſcovering of truth, which men do, but ſees the heart, and ſo knows at the very Inſtant of ſpeaking the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of what is ſaid, and by his Title of <hi>the God of Truth</hi> is obliged not only to hate, but puniſh it: And accordingly you read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.

               <p n="1">1. GOD who gives us all our time, requires ſome part of it to be paid back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as a Rent or Tribute of the whole, thus the Jews kept holy the Seventh day, and we Chriſtians the Lords day; the <hi>Jews</hi> were in their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath eſpecially to remember the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, and we in ours the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, by which a way is made for us into that better world which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57812:82"/>
we expect hereafter. Now this day thus ſet apart is to be imployed in the worſhip and Service of God, and that firſt more ſolemnly and publickly in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from whence no man muſt then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf without juſt cauſe: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, privately at home, in praying with and inſtructing our Families; or elſe in the yet more private duties of the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, as private Prayer, Reading, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that we may be at leaſure to attend theſe, a Reſt from all worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is commanded, and therefore let none think that a bare reſt from Labour is all that is required of him on the Lords day, but the time which he ſaves from the works of his Calling, he is to lay out in theſe Spiritual Duties; For the Lords Day was never given us to be a pretence for Idleneſs, but only to change our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment from Earthly to Heavenly: much leſs was it meant, that by our reſt from our Calling we ſhould have more time free to beſtow upon our ſins; And certainly he that dares ſpend the Lords Day prophanely will not ſtick to be far

worſe upon another, where a Sabbath of ſo few hours becomes ſo weariſom to us upon Earth, Good Lord! what would that man do with an Everlaſting Sabbath in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Command for keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath hath a ſpecial <hi>Memento,</hi> or <hi>Remember</hi> prefixt unto it, that by timely thinking of it, we may lay aſide our worldly buſineſs and get our hearts in an Holy poſture and readineſs for entertainment of God in them. It is the Market day of the Soul, wherein God uſeth to meet thoſe that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely wait upon him, and to diſpence his bleſſings and Graces unto them, the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sanctification whereof preſerves and keeps up the power of Religion in the Soul, and if worldly labour is unlawful upon that day, much more are carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Paſtimes; <hi>It is better to plow than to dance on the Lords Day,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> and when men neglect to puniſh the Profanation thereof, it pleaſeth God ſometimes to take the ſword into his own hands, and by viſible Judgments, to plague the profaneneſs of it; as will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by theſe Examples following.</p>

Not long ſince in <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> a match at Football being appointed upon the Lords Day in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, whilſt two young men were in the Church tolling the Bell to call the Company together, there was ſuddenly heard a clap of Thunder, and a flaſh of Lightning was ſeen by ſome ſitting in the Church-Porch, coming through a dark Lane, and flaſhing in their Faces, which much terrified them, and paſſing through the Porch into the Bellfree, it tripped up his heels that was tolling the Bell, and ſtruck him ſtark dead, and the other that was with him, was ſo ſorely blaſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that ſhortly after he dyed alſo.</p>
               <p n="5">5. At <hi>Alceſter</hi> in <hi>Warwick ſhire,</hi> a luſty young wench went upon the Lords Day not far off, where ſhe ſaid, ſhe would dance as long as ſhe could ſtand, but

while ſhe was dancing, God ſtruck her with a violent Diſeaſe, whereof within two or three days after ſhe dyed: Alſo at the ſame place not long after, a young man preſently, after Evening Sermon was ended, brought a pair of Cudgels into the Street, near the Miniſters Houſe, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon ſeveral to play with him, but they all refuſing, at the length came one who took them up, ſaying, <hi>though I never plaid in my Life, yet I will play one bout now;</hi> but preſently after as he was jeſting with a young woman, he took up a Birding piece, which was charged, ſaying, <hi>Have at thee,</hi> and the Gun going off, ſhot her in the face, whereof ſhe immediately dyed, for which Act he forfeited all his Goods, and underwent the Tryal of the Law.</p>

At <hi>Wooton</hi> in the ſame County, a Milner going forth on the Lords Day, to a Wake, or drinking Match, when he came home at night found his houſe, Mill, and all that he had, burnt down to the ground and deſtroyed.

dancing in a <hi>Smiths</hi> Barn on the Lords Day, to the great grief of the Religious Miniſter of the Town, who endeavoured if poſſible, to have reſtrained, and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. But it pleaſed God, that ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a Fire kindled in that <hi>Smiths Shop,</hi> which burnt it down, together with his houſe and Barn; and raging furiouſly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes with, and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wind, it burnt down many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houſes, moſt of the Inhabitants where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were chief Actors in that Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Day.</p>

deny the Earth fell down upon him, and killed him outright, with the Fall where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his Fellows Limb was broken, who had been likewiſe Partner with him in his Jollity on the Lords Day.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

the <hi>Thames</hi> into an houſe of diſorder and gaming, where they ſpent the reſt of the Lords day, and part of the night likewiſe in Drinking and Revelling; and the next day one of them merrily diſcourſed of his Sabbath days Acts; But on the Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next after, theſe three returning homewards, and attempting to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain over the Ice, they all ſunk down to the bottom like Stones, and one of them only was miraculouſly preſerved, but the other two were drowned. Theſe four laſt are atteſted by ſufficient Teſtimonies. <hi>If ye will not therefore hearken unto me to hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Sabbath day,</hi> as God ſaith, Jer. 17.27. <hi>and not to bear a burden even entring in at the Gates of Jeruſalem on the Sabbath Day, then will I kindle a Fire in the Gates thereof, and it ſhall devour the Pallaces of Jeruſalem, and it ſhall not be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</hi>

                  <head>Of Subſtraction.</head>
                  <p>Subſtraction <hi>is that whereby we take a ſmaller Number from a greater, and find what remains. In</hi> Subſtractions <hi>there are</hi> 3 <hi>Numbers, whereof</hi> 2 <hi>are given, the third ſought by the Rule; the firſt is the Sum or Number given from which you muſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract; the ſecond the Sum to be ſubſtracted; the third is that which remains of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sum, after the leſſer is ſubctracted from it, and is called the remainder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to work by this Rule, you muſt firſt ſet down your greater Sum, out of which you would ſubſtract, in one line.</p>
                  <p>Then underneath ſet your Number to be ſubſtracted; but obſerve to place it ſo that every figure may ſtand under thoſe of your firſt row that are of the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, <hi>pounds</hi> underneath <hi>pounds; ſhillings</hi> underneath <hi>ſhillings,</hi> and ſo of the reſt, and if it be in numbers, ſee that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57812:109"/>
you place <hi>unites</hi> under <hi>unites,</hi> and <hi>tens, hundreds</hi> and <hi>thouſands</hi> (if there be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny figures) all under figures of the ſame denomination.</p>
                  <p>Which done, begin with the firſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure towards your Right Hand, and take it out of that over it; having drawn a Line underneath your Sum, place the Number which remains exactly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, then go to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>third, &amp;c.</hi> till you have done, ſtill ſetting the remainder of each figure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under that from which you <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted</hi> it.</p>

                  <p>According to your Rule foregoing you may ſee how this Sum is to be performed; take firſt 2 from 9, and ſet down the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining 7 underneath, as you ſee in the <hi>Example:</hi> then proceed to your next,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57812:109"/>
which being 4, 4 from 8 the remainder is 4, which place underneath alſo; then 2 from 3 and there remains 1: and laſtly, 3 from 6 and there remains 3, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed underneath you have your Sum perfected, and you find there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains due 3147 <hi>l.</hi>

                  <p>Here are three things to be obſerved; the <hi>Firſt</hi> is when a Figure is to be <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted</hi> from another of the ſame value; as 3 from 3, or the like; in ſuch caſes you muſt write down a Cypher underneath, ſignifying that nought remains.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is when a <hi>Cypher</hi> is to be <hi>ſubſtracted</hi> from a figure, you muſt then ſet down the ſame figure underneath the Cypher, becauſe nothing is to be taken from it, and therefore it is not diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is when a greater figure is to be taken from a leſs, which to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſeems to be a little difficult and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate; but nothing will afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more eaſie; you muſt then borrow <hi>ton</hi> and add to the uppermoſt figure and then <hi>ſubſtract</hi> your figure from that Sum, and ſet down the remainder; but then
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57812:110"/>
you muſt take care to reckon one to the next figure to be <hi>ſubſtracted</hi> in payment for the <hi>ten</hi> you borrowed.</p>
